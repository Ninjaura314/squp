# About

SqUp was initially created for a local clothing store looking to expand their business online using the Squarespace platform.

Most of the procedures used are still optimized for clothing, but with a few modifications can easily be made to fit with any number of item types.

Current fields built into the software are Size and Color, and other fields can be easily configured for use. (NOTE: In development)
