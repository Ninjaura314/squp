Dear ${COMPANY_NAME},
	My name is Jonathan Hoyle, I am the web developer for Lionel Smith Limited in Aiken, South Carolina, a retailer of your products, and I am writing you today regarding the use of your products on our website. We have recently begun doing online sales on our website, an extension of our storefront, where we would like to include your products, so I am writing you today to ask what the procedure is for using those products online. If there is any paperwork that needs to be done or anything else of that nature, I would greatly appreciate any assistance you could give me in obtaining the necessary materials and completing that process so that we can continue adding brands we sell in store on our online store. If we are able to use your products online, I also have a second request regarding the images of those products. Would it be possible to get the images for your products that we can use on our website? This significantly improves my process of uploading the products, as otherwise we have to take new pictures of every product we sell online, so I would greatly appreciate the ability to use your professional images. Thank you in advance for any assistance you can give me in this matter, we are eager to find out how to feature ${COMPANY_NAME} products online as well as in our physical store.
Sincerely,
	Jonathan Hoyle, Web Developer for Lionel Smith Ltd.
